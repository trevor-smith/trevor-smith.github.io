My name is Trevor and I'm currently a data scientist at Metis.  I use Python as my language of choice for data analysis, but also use R from time to time depending on the problem.  I am also learning common web development languages (Javascript, HTML, CSS) so that I can share my data visualizations over the web interactively :)

My background before Metis was in Marketing Analytics, specifically digital media attribution, where I helped companies and agencies optimize their online marketing campaigns.  I was focused around scalable client implementation, communicating results effectively to our clients, and for helping push our software platform forward with new innovative ideas.

I am industry agnostic, I just enjoy solving challenging big data problems!  I like helping companies scale and also digging into the data to tell a compelling story.

## Data Science Interests

When it comes to data science, I absolutely LOVE to nerd out.  I'd rather read a statistics book or a blog post than watch the latest funny youtube video or mindlessly browse the internet.  That being said, some of my particular interests are:

- classification algorithms
- natural language processing
- compelling visualizations (d3, i'm looking at you!)
- parallel processing (looking to improve my skills here)

## Other (Less Awesome) Interests

- track and field
- tuner cars
- nba
- fantasy sports
    - currently building my own analytics engine for nba
- mexican food

## Education

I graduated from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) with a degree in Quantitative Economics and a minor in Statistics.  My coursework was mostly focused on econometrics and statistics and was very theoretical in nature.  The goal of the Quantitative Economics degree was to prepare students for jobs in analytics or for advanced degrees in Economics or other technical fields.  Even though many of my courses were technical in nature, there was a fair amount of course work involving applying theory to actual data sets.  My main tool for statistical analysis was R.  This has now changed to Python, but I still come back to R from time to time.
