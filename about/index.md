My name is Trevor and I'm currently a data scientist at Metis.  My background before Metis was in Marketing Analytics, specifically digital media attribution, where I helped companies and agencies optimize their online marketing campaigns.  I was focused around scalable client implementation, communicating results effectively to our clients, and for helping push our software platform forward with new innovative ideas.

I am industry agnostic, I just enjoy solving challenging big data problems!  I like helping companies scale and also digging into the data to tell a compelling story.

## Data Science Interests

When it comes to data science, I absolutely LOVE to nerd out.  I'd rather read a statistics book or a blog post than watch the latest funny youtube video or mindlessly browse the internet.  That being said, some of my particular interests are:

- classification algorithms
- natural language processing
- compelling visualizations (d3, i'm looking at you!)
- parallel processing (looking to improve my skills here)
